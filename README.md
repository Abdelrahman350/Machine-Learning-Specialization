# Machine-Learning-Specialization
#### In this Repository, I put my solutions to the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. Introduced by Washington university. These solutions are done using TuriCreate and Scikit Learn.

This Specialization from leading researchers at the University of Washington introduces learners to the exciting, high-demand field of Machine Learning. Through a series of practical case studies, learners will gain applied experience in major areas of Machine Learning including Prediction, Classification, Clustering, and Information Retrieval. Learners will learn to analyze large and complex datasets, create systems that adapt and improve over time, and build intelligent applications that can make predictions from data.

Learners will implement and apply predictive, classification, clustering, and information retrieval machine learning algorithms to real datasets throughout each course in the specialization. They will walk away with applied machine learning and Python programming experience.
